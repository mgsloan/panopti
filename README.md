# Panopti Type-Vis

*A work-in-progress tool to aid understanding and manipulating Haskell.*

## Dependencies / Installation

## Scope

This is a restricted-scope fork of panopti, intent on developing the type
visualization scheme, and dropping the crufty type resolution scheme.  This is
motivated by Luite Stegeman coming up with far superior interrogation of GHC's 
API, making a good deal of panopti's stuff cruft.
